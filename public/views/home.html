            <p>Could it really be? No, surely not! Is it <em>actually</em> Roger Moore? Who am I? What do I do? What are my interests? Is he some sort of programmer? Or maybe he's a film star? Is he a saint? For whose eyes only? Is it really golden? Does he have a LinkedIn? So many questions. Find all of this out and more if you head over to the about section of this website. Thrilling, right?</p>

            <p>Take a look at some of the projects that I have worked on in the past. This is probably a bit more visually pleasing than my GitHub page, as I have provided more in-depth descriptions and screenshots to help portray the project in the light in which it was meant. These projects range from when I first started documenting them, really. So there are a mixture of college and university projects, as well as projects that I have worked on in my spare time.</p>
