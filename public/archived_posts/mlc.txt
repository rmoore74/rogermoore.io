This is a little project that I’ve been working on. I’ve named it the ‘Magic Link Cloaker’! Simply, it is just a small web application that takes long and unsightly URLs and converts them to a shorter, more user-friendly URL. I was inspired to work on this project whilst journeying down some internet marketing ventures.

Features
This web script is pretty straightforward and has only a few functions but I’ll list them below anyway. One of the main things that I’m excited about implementing in this script is the analytics.

Cloak links
Manage links
Collect/view statistics
Update account settings
Easy install
Easy uninstall
Change directory of cloaked links


Here are some screenshots of the UI for Magic Link Cloaker.
